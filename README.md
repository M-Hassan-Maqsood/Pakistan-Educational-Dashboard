# Pakistan-Educational-Dashboard
This is a dashboard that visualizes **Pakistan's Educational System**
Iâ€™ve created a Pakistan Education Statistics Dashboard that helps visualize and explore educational data across Pakistan. It uses data collected over many years to show key insights about school facilities, student enrollment rates, and education scores in different areas of the country.

Here's a breakdown of the main features:
**School Infrastructure:** This part shows data on the number of primary and secondary schools, whether they are one-room schools, and whether they have important facilities.
**Education Scores:** You can view scores like enrollment rates, gender balance in schools, and infrastructure quality. These scores can be filtered to focus on specific cities and years.
**Enrollment Trends:** This section tracks enrollment for boys and girls and highlights how many primary schools are fully equipped to teach all grades.

A yearly slider lets users see how these stats change over time, and the dashboard includes easy-to-read charts like **bars, lines, and pies**. A simple color theme is used to make everything visually clear and organized.
This dashboard is ideal for policymakers, educators, and anyone interested in understanding and improving education in Pakistan.
